If you are familiar to Program R, modules in python are similar to libraries in R. Each module contains a set of functions which can be used to process data. One of the main benefits to running the code in google colab is that doesn't require you download any modules to you local hard drive and instead runs everything in the cloud. When you run the code you will need to connect the colab notebook to your google account and allow permission to access your google drive. This will let you download the vence data to your personal google drive account.
